# EEG-Signal-Analysis-for-Mental-Condition-and-Emotion-Detetction# EEG Signal Analysis for Schizophrenia Detection and Emotion Recognition

This project focuses on analyzing EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals to identify patterns associated with schizophrenia and human emotions using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It leverages signal processing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to support early diagnosis and emotion recognition applications.

## Objectives

- Detect schizophrenia from EEG data
- Recognize emotional states using brainwave signals
- Employ preprocessing, feature extraction (e.g., FFT, DWT), and classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, CNN)

## Dataset

- Schizophrenia Dataset: [e.g., Kaggle / PhysioNet / Local Clinical Dataset]
- Emotion Dataset: [e.g., DEAP, SEED, or DREAMER]
