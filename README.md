# EEG-Signal-Analysis-for-Mental-Condition-and-Emotion-Detetction
This project focuses on analyzing EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals to detect schizophrenia and recognize human emotions using machine learning techniques. By extracting meaningful features from brainwave patterns, the system aims to support early diagnosis of mental health conditions and enhance affective computing applications.
